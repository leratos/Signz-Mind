## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Signz-Mind,  
please report it privately via a GitHub issue (mark as "Security") or by email to [marcus.kohtz@signz-vision.com].

I aim to respond within 7 days and will keep you updated about the status of your report and any planned actions.

Public security updates and advisories will be published directly in the GitHub repository under "Releases" and "Security advisories."

Thank you for helping to keep this project secure!
